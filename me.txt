Hi,

As a graduate data analyst and data scientist majoring in Economics, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs.

I am experienced in Econometrics and Financial Analysis, and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use MS Excel, Rand Stata for my data projects.

Currently a Data Analyst Intern in Vodafone-Idea, I am also pursuing an M. Sc in Applied Economics from the Presidency University, Kolkata.
